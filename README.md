# cms-ars-3.1-moderate-aws-rds-infrastructure-cis-overlay
InSpec profile overlay to validate the secure configuration of AWS RDS Infrastructure against the [CIS's](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/) Amazon Web Services Three-tier Web Architecture Benchmark v1.0.0 tailored for [CMS ARS 3.1](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/InformationSecurity/Info-Security-Library-Items/ARS-31-Publication.html) for CMS systems categorized as Moderate.

## Getting Started  
It is intended and recommended that InSpec and this profile overlay be run from a __"runner"__ host (such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop) against the target remotely over __ssh__.

__For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the _latest version_ of InSpec and supporting Ruby language components.__ 

Latest versions and installation options are available at the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.

This overlay also requires the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) which is available at the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) site.

Git is required to download the latest InSpec profiles using the instructions below. Git can be downloaded from the [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) site. 

## Tailoring to Your Environment
The following inputs must be configured in an inputs ".yml" file for the profile to run correctly for your specific environment. More information about InSpec inputs can be found in the [InSpec Profile Documentation](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/profiles/).
 
```
# Description: Identifier for the database instance (e.g., ['test', 'post']).
db_instance_identifier: []
    
# Description: Security group identifier for virtual private cloud (e.g., ['sg-04de43a5bab54586c']).
vpc_security_group_id: []

# Description: Allowed range of IP addresses (e.g., '0.0.0.0/0').
allowed_ip_address_range: ''
```
## Configuring Your Environment
Prior to running this overlay, certain credentials and permissions need to be established for the AWS CLI to work properly. 

1. The IAM account used to run this profile against the AWS environment needs to be attached through a group or role with at least `AWS IAM "ReadOnlyAccess" Managed Policy`. 

2. If running in an AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) environment, derived credentials are needed to use the AWS CLI. Default `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` will not satisfy the MFA Policies in the CMS AWS environments. To do this, the AWS CLI environment needs to have the right system environment variables set with your AWS region and credentials and session key. InSpec supports the following standard AWS variables:

- `AWS_REGION`
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`

The environment variables can be set using the following commands.

````
# Set required ENV variables
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<key-id>
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<access-key>
$ export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<session_token>
$ export AWS_REGION='<region>'
````

More information about these credentials and permissions can be found in the [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/get-session-token.html) documentation and [AWS Profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html) documentation.

A useful bash script for automating this process is [here](https://gist.github.com/dinvlad/d1bc0a45419abc277eb86f2d1ce70625)

Furthermore, to generate credentials using an AWS Profile you will need to use the following AWS CLI commands.

  a. `aws sts get-session-token --serial-number arn:aws:iam::<$YOUR-MFA-SERIAL> --token-code <$YOUR-CURRENT-MFA-TOKEN> --profile=<$YOUR-AWS-PROFILE>` 

  b. Then export the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` that was generated by the above command.

## Running This Overlay Directly from Github

```
# How to run
inspec exec https://github.com/CMSgov/cms-ars-3.1-moderate-aws-rds-infrastructure-cis-overlay/archive/master.tar.gz --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --target aws:// --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>
```

### Different Run Options

  [Full exec options](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/cli/#options-3)

## Running This Overlay from a local Archive copy
If your runner is not always expected to have direct access to GitHub, use the following steps to create an archive bundle of this overlay and all of its dependent tests:

(Git is required to clone the InSpec profile using the instructions below. Git can be downloaded from the [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) site.)

When the __"runner"__ host uses this profile overlay for the first time, follow these steps: 

```
mkdir profiles
cd profiles
git clone https://github.com/CMSgov/cms-ars-3.1-moderate-aws-rds-infrastructure-cis-overlay.git
inspec exec cms-ars-3.1-moderate-aws-rds-infrastructure-cis-overlay --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --target aws:// --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json> 
```

For every successive run, follow these steps to always have the latest version of this overlay and dependent profiles:

```
cd profiles/cms-ars-3.1-moderate-aws-rds-infrastructure-cis-overlay
git pull
cd ..
inspec exec cms-ars-3.1-moderate-aws-rds-infrastructure-cis-overlay --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --target aws:// --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json> 
```

## Using Heimdall for Viewing the JSON Results

The JSON results output file can be loaded into __[heimdall-lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org/)__ for a user-interactive, graphical view of the InSpec results. 

The JSON InSpec results file may also be loaded into a __[full heimdall server](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall)__, allowing for additional functionality such as to store and compare multiple profile runs.
